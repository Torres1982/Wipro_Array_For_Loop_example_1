# Wipro_Array_For_Loop_example_1

### Technologies used:
1. Kotlin

### Assignment Description:
Any array may be viewed as a number of "runs" of equal numbers.
For example, the following array has two runs:
{1, 1, 1, 2, 2} - Three 1's in a row form the first run, and two 2's form the second.
This array has two runs of length one: {3, 4}
And this one has five runs: {1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
Implement the runs() function so that it returns the number of runs in the given array.
